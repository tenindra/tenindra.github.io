Welcome to my home on the internet! I completed my PhD on <a href="https://monash.figshare.com/articles/In_Search_of_Points_of_Interest_A_Story_of_Decoupled_Heuristics_on_Road_Networks/8970947/1"> POI search algortithms for road network graphs</a> at Monash University under <a href="http://www.aamircheema.com">Prof. Aamir Cheema</a>. I was a postdoctoral fellow with the Grab-NUS AI Laboratory at the National University of Singapore and a Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow. I received my bachelors degrees (B.Eng and B.Sc) from the University of New South Wales.
