I'm a Research Scientist at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. My research focuses on developing efficient, scalable, and theoretically robust algorithms, with particular emphasis on big data management and analytics, graphs, combinatorial optimization, and AI. 

More broadly, having spent time deploying my research in industry, I’m interested in bridging the gap between research and practice — so scientific advances can more easily translate into meaningful real-world impact.
