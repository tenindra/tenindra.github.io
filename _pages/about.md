Welcome to my new page! I'm a researcher passionate about finding intuitive ideas to solve real-world computing problems and developing them into efficient, theoretically robust, and scalable algorithms. My areas of interest are data management, graph algorithms, and data science with applications in location and map-based services. 

<b>Bio:</b> I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Monash University under <a href="http://www.aamircheema.com">Prof. Aamir Cheema</a>. I have previously been a Data Scientist at Grab, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Grab-NUS AI Laboratory at the National University of Singapore, and an Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow at CUHK. I received my bachelor's degrees (B.Eng and B.Sc) from the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
