Hello and welcome to my page! I'm interested in finding easy-to-grasp intuitions and turning them into well-developed, robust, and scalable algorithms that work well in practice. My areas of interest are broadly data management, graph algorithms, and data science with applications in location and map-based services. 

Bio: I completed my PhD on POI search algorithms for road network graphs at Monash University under <a href="http://www.aamircheema.com">Prof. Aamir Cheema</a>. I have previously been a Lead Data Scientist at Grab, a postdoctoral fellow with the Grab-NUS AI Laboratory at the National University of Singapore, and an Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow in Hong Kong. I received my bachelor's degrees (B.Eng and B.Sc) from the University of New South Wales.
