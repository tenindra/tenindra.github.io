I'm a Research Scientist at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Tokyo, Japan! My broad interest is to bridge the gap between fundamental research into computational problems and their application in practice. In particular, I am interested in developing intuitive algorithms that are efficient, scalable, and theoretically robust, with emphasis on real-world big data, graph, combinatorial optimization, and learning problems.

Background: I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Monash University under <a href="http://www.aamircheema.com">Prof. Aamir Cheema</a>. I have previously been a Data Scientist at Grab Inc., a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Data Science at the National University of Singapore, and an Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I received my bachelorâ€™s degrees (B.Eng and B.Sc) from the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
