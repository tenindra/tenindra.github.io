I'm a Research Scientist at the <a href='https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/'>RIKEN Center for Computational Science</a>. My research focuses on developing efficient, scalable, and theoretically robust algorithms, with particular emphasis on AI, big data analytics, graphs, and combinatorial problems. 

Having had the opportunity to apply some of my research in industry, Iâ€™m also keen to help bridge the gap between research and practice, so scientific advances can more easily translate into meaningful real-world impact.
