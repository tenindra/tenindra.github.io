I’m a Research Scientist at RIKEN in Tokyo, Japan! My work is driven by the pursuit of bridging research on fundamental computational problems and their practical applications. Specifically, I am interested in creating algorithms that are efficient, scalable, and theoretically robust, with a focus on big data analytics, graphs, combinatorial optimization, and learning, all with real-world applications in mind.

Background: I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Monash University under <a href="http://www.aamircheema.com">Prof. Aamir Cheema</a>. I have previously been a Data Scientist at Grab Inc., a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Data Science at the National University of Singapore, and an Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I received my bachelor’s degrees (B.Eng and B.Sc) from the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
