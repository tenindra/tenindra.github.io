I'm a Research Scientist (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. My research interests are in developing algorithms that are simple in principle, scalable in practice, and shaped by a theoretical lens with an emphasis on formalization. 

With experience applying my research in industry, I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between academic research and real-world deployment. My work typically explores topics related to AI, graphs, large-scale datasets, and combinatorial problems.
