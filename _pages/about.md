I'm a Research Scientist at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science! My research focuses on developing efficient, scalable, and theoretically sound algorithms, with a particular emphasis on big data management and analytics, graphs, combinatorial optimization, and learning. More broadly, I am passionate about finding ways to bridge the gap between research and its practical applications, so it can translate more easily into meaningful real-world impact. 

Previously, I completed my PhD at Monash University under <a href="http://www.aamircheema.com">Prof. Aamir Cheema</a>. I have also been a Data Scientist at Grab Inc., a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Data Science at the National University of Singapore, and an Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow. I received my B.Eng and B.Sc from the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
