I'm a Research Scientist (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. My research interests are in developing algorithms that are intuitive in principle, scalable in practice, and shaped by a theoretical lens. 

My work typically explores topics related to AI, graphs, large-scale data management, and combinatorial problems. With experience applying my research in industry, I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between academic research and real-world deployment.
